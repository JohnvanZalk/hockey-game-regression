# hockey-game-regression

The Jupyter Notebook in this respository contains an analysis of factors contributing to game outcomes in the National Hockey League.

The statistical test used for this analysis is a multiple logistic regression because game outcomes are binary (win or loss) and there are several explanatory variables.

Some explanotry variables include:
* **FO%:** A face-off is the method used to begin and restart play. FO% is the percentage that a team wins the face-off.
* **BS:** Blocked shots
* **PP%:** If one team incurs a penalty, the other team get's a power-play (more players on ice). PP% is that percentage that a team scores on their power-play.
